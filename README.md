### Climate Impact Report of the Eco-village Network of Ukraine

#### Introduction
This report summarizes the climate impact of the Eco-village Network of Ukraine over the past 12 months. It includes metrics on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions from the installation of solar energy systems, replacement of diesel generators, and the conservation and restoration of forest and wetland ecosystems. The calculations are based on the metrics provided by the Climate Solutions Metrics Garden.

#### 1. Installed Solar Energy Systems

**Villages with Solar Installations:**
1. Charyvne
2. Omelyanivka
3. Zeleni Kruchi
4. Prostor Lyubovi
5. Vasylivka
6. Tepla Hora
7. Ladoslavne
8. Zhivyi Dim
9. Zhiva Khata

**Total Installed Capacity:**
- 9 systems * 3 kW = 27 kW

**Annual Energy Generation:**
- 9 systems * 4.38 MWh = 39.42 MWh

**CO2 Emissions Reduction:**
- 39.42 MWh / 2.396 MWh = 16.45 tons of CO2 per year

#### 2. Replacement of Diesel Generators

**Bluetti Power Stations:**
- 6 stations with 600 Wh each

**Estimated CO2 Emissions Reduction:**
- Fuel consumption for 6 stations per year: 6 stations * 0.5 gallons/hour * 4 hours/day * 365 days = 4380 gallons
- 4380 gallons / 99 = 44.24 tons of CO2 per year

#### 3. Conserved Forest and Wetland Ecosystems

**Conserved Areas:**
1. Omelyanivka – 100 ha of forest
2. Lagulske (Prostor Lyubovi) – 100 ha of forest and wetlands
3. Zelena Laguna (Hranidub) – 100 ha of forest and wetlands
4. Forest reserve near Rosy – 100 ha of forest

**Total Conserved Forest Area:**
- 400 ha

**Carbon Sequestration for Conserved Forests:**
- 400 ha * 2.25 tons CO2/ha/year = 900 tons of CO2 per year

#### 4. Restored Forest and Wetland Ecosystems

**Restored Areas:**
1. Tartak (Kedry Polissya) – 50 ha
2. Settlements on degraded lands (50 ha each):
   - Ladoslavne
   - Raduga
   - Kedry Polissya (Zhytomyr region)
   - Stozhary
   - Rodnyky (Kharkiv region)
   - Rosy (Kyiv region)
   - Kedrovka
   - Lyubske (Kyiv region)

**Total Restored Forest Area:**
- 450 ha

**Carbon Sequestration for Restored Forests:**
- 450 ha * 2.25 tons CO2/ha/year = 1012.5 tons of CO2 per year

#### Overall Summary

**Total Annual CO2 Emissions Reduction:**
1. Installed solar energy systems: 16.45 tons CO2
2. Replacement of diesel generators: 44.24 tons CO2
3. Conserved ecosystems: 900 tons CO2
4. Restored ecosystems: 1012.5 tons CO2

**Total CO2 Emissions Reduction:**
- 16.45 + 44.24 + 900 + 1012.5 = 1973.19 tons of CO2 per year

This consolidated report demonstrates the significant climate impact of the Eco-village Network of Ukraine, contributing to substantial GHG emissions reductions and promoting environmental sustainability through the use of renewable energy and the restoration of natural ecosystems. The calculations are based on the metrics provided by the Climate Solutions Metrics Garden.
