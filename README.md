#### Introduction
This report summarizes the climate impact of the Eco-village Network of Ukraine over the past 12 months. It includes metrics on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions from the installation of solar energy systems, replacement of diesel generators, conservation and restoration of forest and wetland ecosystems, and the impact of animal grazing projects. The calculations are based on the metrics provided by the Climate Solutions Metrics Garden.

#### 1. Installed Solar Energy Systems

**Villages with Solar Installations:**
1. Charyvne
2. Omelyanivka
3. Zeleni Kruchi
4. Prostor Lyubovi
5. Vasylivka
6. Tepla Hora
7. Ladoslavne
8. Zhivyi Dim
9. Zhiva Khata
10. Kovalyne

**Total Installed Capacity:**
- 10 systems * 3 kW = 30 kW

**Annual Energy Generation:**
- 10 systems * 4.38 MWh = 43.8 MWh

**CO2 Emissions Reduction:**
- 43.8 MWh / 2.396 MWh = 18.29 tons of CO2 per year

The Eco-village Network of Ukraine has successfully installed solar energy systems across ten settlements. These installations have a combined capacity of 30 kW, significantly reducing reliance on fossil fuels. On average, these systems generate 4.38 MWh of clean energy annually per installation, totaling 43.8 MWh for all ten settlements. This shift to renewable energy has led to a substantial reduction in CO2 emissions, amounting to 18.29 tons per year. This effort not only mitigates the impact of climate change but also serves as a model for sustainable energy use in rural communities.

#### 2. Replacement of Diesel Generators

**Bluetti Power Stations:**
- 6 stations with 600 Wh each

**Estimated CO2 Emissions Reduction:**
- Fuel consumption for 6 stations per year: 6 stations * 0.5 gallons/hour * 4 hours/day * 365 days = 4380 gallons
- 4380 gallons / 99 = 44.24 tons of CO2 per year

In addition to solar installations, the network has replaced several diesel generators with Bluetti power stations. These six stations, each with a capacity of 600 Wh, are now used instead of conventional diesel generators. This transition significantly reduces diesel fuel consumption, which, for these six stations, would have otherwise been 4380 gallons per year. By replacing diesel with clean energy sources, we have reduced CO2 emissions by 44.24 tons annually. This initiative is part of our broader strategy to lower greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable energy practices within our communities.

#### 3. Conserved Forest and Wetland Ecosystems

**Conserved Areas:**
1. Omelyanivka – 100 ha of forest
2. Lagulske (Prostor Lyubovi) – 100 ha of forest and wetlands
3. Zelena Laguna (Hranidub) – 100 ha of forest and wetlands
4. Forest reserve near Rosy – 100 ha of forest

**Total Conserved Forest Area:**
- 400 ha

**Carbon Sequestration for Conserved Forests:**
- 400 ha * 2.25 tons CO2/ha/year = 900 tons of CO2 per year

The conservation efforts within the network have led to the protection of significant areas of forest and wetlands. Specifically, we have conserved 100 hectares each in Omelyanivka, Lagulske, Zelena Laguna, and near Rosy. These areas collectively amount to 400 hectares. The conserved forests play a crucial role in carbon sequestration, capturing approximately 2.25 tons of CO2 per hectare per year. This equates to a total of 900 tons of CO2 sequestered annually. These efforts not only preserve biodiversity and natural habitats but also enhance the ecosystem's ability to combat climate change through natural carbon capture.

#### 4. Restored Forest and Wetland Ecosystems

**Restored Areas:**
1. Tartak (Kedry Polissya) – 50 ha
2. Settlements on degraded lands (50 ha each):
   - Ladoslavne
   - Raduga
   - Kedry Polissya (Zhytomyr region)
   - Stozhary
   - Rodnyky (Kharkiv region)
   - Rosy (Kyiv region)
   - Kedrovka
   - Lyubske (Kyiv region)

**Total Restored Forest Area:**
- 450 ha

**Carbon Sequestration for Restored Forests:**
- 450 ha * 2.25 tons CO2/ha/year = 1012.5 tons of CO2 per year

Our network has also undertaken extensive restoration projects, focusing on degraded lands. We have restored 50 hectares in Tartak and an additional 50 hectares each in settlements such as Ladoslavne, Raduga, Kedry Polissya, Stozhary, Rodnyky, Rosy, Kedrovka, and Lyubske. This totals 450 hectares of restored forest and wetland ecosystems. These restored areas sequester approximately 2.25 tons of CO2 per hectare annually, resulting in a total sequestration of 1012.5 tons of CO2 per year. Restoration activities improve soil health, increase biodiversity, and enhance the land's natural ability to store carbon, contributing significantly to climate mitigation.

#### 5. Impact of Animal Grazing Projects

**Project "Bhoomi" (Mykolaiv region)**
- Number of cows: 247 cows, calves, and bulls
- Land area: 300 ha (150 ha for pastures, 150 ha for orchards and farming)
- Permanent residents: 7 families (18 people), 5 temporary residents

**Project "Podkova" (Gluboki Balyky, Kyiv region)**
- Land area: 5 ha
- Number of goats: 20 goats

**Carbon Sequestration from Grazing Projects:**
- Regenerative grazing practices can sequester approximately 0.5 to 1.5 tons of CO2 per hectare per year.
- For Bhoomi: 150 ha * 1 ton CO2/ha/year = 150 tons of CO2 per year
- For Podkova: 5 ha * 1 ton CO2/ha/year = 5 tons of CO2 per year

**Total Carbon Sequestration from Grazing Projects:**
- 150 + 5 = 155 tons of CO2 per year

Our animal grazing projects, such as "Bhoomi" in Mykolaiv region and "Podkova" in Kyiv region, integrate regenerative practices that enhance soil health and sequester carbon. "Bhoomi" project, covering 300 hectares with 247 cows, dedicates 150 hectares to pastures. "Podkova" covers 5 hectares with 20 goats. These regenerative grazing practices improve the soil's capacity to sequester carbon, estimated at about 1 ton of CO2 per hectare per year. This results in a sequestration of 150 tons of CO2 annually for "Bhoomi" and 5 tons for "Podkova," totaling 155 tons of CO2 per year. These projects demonstrate how sustainable livestock management can contribute to climate mitigation while supporting local livelihoods.

#### Overall Summary

**Total Annual CO2 Emissions Reduction:**
1. Installed solar energy systems: 18.29 tons CO2
2. Replacement of diesel generators: 44.24 tons CO2
3. Conserved ecosystems: 900 tons CO2
4. Restored ecosystems: 1012.5 tons CO2
5. Animal grazing projects: 155 tons CO2

**Total CO2 Emissions Reduction:**
- 18.29 + 44.24 + 900 + 1012.5 + 155 = 2130.03 tons of CO2 per year

This consolidated report demonstrates the significant climate impact of the Eco-village Network of Ukraine, contributing to substantial GHG emissions reductions and promoting environmental sustainability through the use of renewable energy, the restoration of natural ecosystems, and sustainable animal grazing practices. The calculations are based on the metrics provided by the Climate Solutions Metrics Garden.
